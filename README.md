# tdeemon

Self-hosted, AI-first nutrition tracking with an adaptive TDEE.

Log meals by chat or photo from any AI client (via MCP) or the built-in
chat; tdeemon does the math, learns your real energy expenditure from
intake and weight trend, and lets an AI coach adjust your goals — cut,
maintenance, bulk or recomp — within guardrails you control.

> **Status: design phase.** Nothing is built yet. The full design lives
> in [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Planned highlights

- One container, one SQLite file, multi-user (household or friends).
- MCP server: use Claude, ChatGPT, a local model or any MCP client.
- Built-in chat with your own API key, photo logging, PWA.
- Apple Health import (Health Auto Export), later native HealthKit.
- Adaptive calibration with confidence intervals; AI changes plans only
  through proposals you accept, and limits are enforced in code.
